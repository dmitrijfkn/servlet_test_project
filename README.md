# servlet_test_project
This is  test project on servlets, which is done completely wrong and needs to be fixed, but it works.

To start the server, you should:
1. Open the project in the IDE;
2. Add my-SQL-connector to project dependencies;
3. Import Maven dependencies if auto-import turned off;
4. Add new db to your SQL server (servletsdb.sql) in project files;
5. Change SQL connection URL in db.ConectionURL;
6. (Optional) Start the tests;
7. Add Tomcat to configurations;
8. Start Tomcat.
